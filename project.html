      <h3> Problem </h3>
      <div class="problem">
        <p> The client wanted to enter to cloud storage market by designing a product that includes the features of saving web content, organizing, creating, and uploading files etc.<br>
          Users often find that recipe organization is complicated from all source in one place. It's not always obvious who you are sharing with or what access they have. Users having difficult time to remember substitute ingredients for restricted diet.</p>
        </div>
        <h3> Solution </h3>
        <div class="solution">
          <p> Healthy Portions aims to address these concerns by providing these features. My biggest design challenge was to offer users a way to quickly find interesting recipes and to search for subsitutute ingredients easily and edit the recipe according to their needs.<br>
            Healthy Portion design became more polished, clear, and user-friendly as it went through multiple iterations based on two rounds of Usability Testing, Preference Testing, and feedback from senior designers.

        <h3 class="change"> Assumptions </h3>
        <div class="assumptions">
          <p> When it comes to cooking, users are divided into 3 groups :<br>
            1- People who never know what to cook .<br>
            2- People who plan their menu in advance and<br>
            3- The people in between who want to have a lot of ideas, but they need to make up their mind.<br><br>
            There are 3 main ways to make up your mind what to cook :<br>
            1- Use well-known recipes<br>
            2- Search them on the Internet<br>
            3- Experiment with the ingredients left in the fridge.<br><br>

            Along with most people, I happen to be the third type of person. Who is the general consumers of the fast-growing recipe storage market. Over the years, I have tried a few recipe apps, some provide big database of interesting recipes and their moderation other offers mobile apps because it’s easier to use them in the kitchen. So when prompted to create a cloud storage app I decided to put all of those great features together and see if anyone else shares my problems.

                                  The battle for the cloud storage market may not be life and death, but it is important to know one’s or competitors when creating a product. Big Oven and Epicurious are big names in recipe cloud storage while Pinterest has carved out its own niche by providing something unique. I performed a SWOT analysis of these three competitors.

                                      <p>As a recommended healthy portion size is the amount of each food that you are supposed to eat during a meal or snack. USDA has provided a variety of nutrition guides and divided a plate into four section.  Keeping all these in mind, I come up with the idea of a portion plate for logo. A Knife and a Fork beside a plate help visualize the actual “Healthy Portions”.<br>
                                        I made sure that our logo combination must pass the WCAG AA test (for the people with color vision deficiency).

                                      <p>User Surveys proved to be very beneficial in providing a focus on creating our product. Researching User Flows for competitors was also helpful in guiding us on what screens and modal windows to create. Users responded positively to the line illustrations of the final design. Feedback from senior designers, Usability Tests, and Preference Tests helped me to fine-tune visuals and specific elements of UIs. Perhaps the biggest changes made throughout the design process was organizing screen evolution.
                                        The rounds of Usability Testing revealed tasks, instructions, or processes that seemed clear to me, but were not so clear to different users. This helped me to see and realize things I could not surmise on my own. The Preference Test helped me to make design decisions that were challenging to make on my own. </p>

                                        <p>It was both challenging and fun to design “Healthy Portions” from start to current finish product. Throughout this process, I learned that the more testing you can do the better, and it's okay to love an idea, but you have to be willing to let it go too.Lastly, I learned that it is more important to have finished good enough project than an unfinished “perfect” project. it’s amazing how helping my users give me a new, humbling perspective on my own goal s,  designing products that positively impact and serve the greater good. </p>
