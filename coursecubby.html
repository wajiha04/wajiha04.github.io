    <h3> Problem</h3>
    <div class="problem">
      <p>Students that are enthusiastic about online learning have numerous reasons for preferring the virtual format,  it’s flexibility and the ability to study and learn on ‘my time’ are the main reasons. But they also face these problems,<br><br>

        1. It takes a lot of time to search for free quality resources.<br><br>
        2. It's cost alot of money to explore different career paths or interests.<br><br>
        3. Knowing the quality of a course contents can be difficult.<br><br>
        4. There are a lot of sites that offer online course and saving courses from multiple sites can be hard to keep track of.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3 class="change">User Awareness</h3>
    <div class="solution">
      <p>Most of our users go to third party sources to find reviews on courses or content and they often spend a lot of time searching for decent material. Some people even said they spent more than a week looking for resources and thats just way to much time - and most of them ended up purchasing course without knowing any insights of it, that result fail to engage in the learning process at all, </p>
    </div>

    <h3> Solution </h3>
    <div class="solution">
      <p> “Course Cubby” is a online course platform that collects courses and tutorials from other sites. Course Cubby will have following unique features,<br>

        * Let the users decide what skill they are interested in , by providing free resources.<br>

        * Let user read reviews for instructors and courses.will cater to a wide audience by providing a unique experience for the user.<br>
      </p>
    </div>
    <!-- <h1 class="hgroup" > Process </h1> -->
    <h3 class="change"> Assumptions </h3>
    <div class="assumptions">
      <p> I made some general assumptions about people and the resources available online:<br><br>

        Most of our users go to third party sources to find reviews on courses or content and they often spend a lot of time searching for decent material.<br><br>

        Some people even said they spent more than a week looking for resources and that's just way to much time - and most of them ended up purchasing course without knowing any insights of it, that result fail to engage in the learning process at all.<br><br>

        In order to understand how I arrived at the solutions to the problems at hand, I needed to identify the  competition’s differentiators and weaknesses.<br><br>

      </p>
    </div>
    <h3 class="change"> User Research </h3>
    <div class="users">
      <p> Now a days I feel like most people have already taken a course of some sort online. Some people have even tried to figure out if they like a certain career path by taking courses online. But it can be very difficult to do so. I’ve tried.<br><br>
        Finding resources that give you a good skills of any job market can be nearly impossible or at the very least you can find okay resources. User wanted an easier, cheaper way to learn what career path they are most interested in.
        People believe that college is just too expensive for experimenting.<br><br>
        Next I sent out a User Survey to determine what users insights here are key findings.

                                      <p>I did some pen and paper sketches, to capture imagery related to the desired brand identity. Images include cubby, book, graduation hat and Initials with relevant icons.<br>
                                        I made sure that our logo combination must pass the WCAG AA test (for the people with color vision deficiency).

                                        All logo goes through preference test , a senior designer noted that Paprika
                                        was a stronger looking typeface and did not match with logo mark. I therefore made an other logo. The typeface of logo wordmark is Hermeneus One. I had to redo the brand mark as well to match the stroke width of the new logo type. So our final logo is,

                                                  Users were given three tasks, and they provided valuable feedback for how to improve clarity and user-friendliness for the product.<br>

Researching User Flows for competitors was also helpful in guiding us on what screens and mockup windows to create. Users responded positively to the line illustrations of the final design. But there were several places and opportunities for users to be confused, because there are plans to include drag and drop functionality for the final product.</p><br>

I would conduct Usability Tests using the Mobile version if I had more time on this project.</p> <br>

                                                  <p>The initial project brief was a bit overwhelming .Starting with the first User Surveys, user input helped to narrow the scope of the project and point us toward data privacy. The rounds of Usability Testing revealed tasks, instructions, or processes that seemed
                                                    clear to me, but were not so clear to different users. This helped me to see and realize things I could not surmise on my own. The Preference Test helped me to make design decisions that were challenging to make on my own.</p>

                                                    <br>  <p>Throughout this project, I learned so much about people and what they expect from simple sites. For example, even the site purpose was explained to a few users, they still wanted the website to do more, like take notes etc .
                                                      So one big takeaway was that if there is an all-in-one solution people will take that over a perfect partial solution.
                                                      <br><br>Secondly, I learned that many people want to explore what it's like to try different skills without paying thousands of dollars or several of hours to find out it's just not for them.

                                                      <br><br>It is more important to have finished good enough project than an unfinished “perfect” project. it’s amazing how helping my users give me a new, humbling perspective on my own goal s,  designing products that positively impact and serve the greater good.

                                                      <br><br>So let's create more meaningful products that solve issues like this.
